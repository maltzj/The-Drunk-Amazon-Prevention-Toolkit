Have you ever had a few (or more than a few) drinks and thought "you know what I need to do?  Buy some random crap at Amazon".  If you haven't, then consider yourself lucky, because there's nothing worse than waking up to $200 dollars in credit card charges and a useless pile of "deals" from Amazon headed towards your doorstep.  

This chrome extension will stop you from becoming a victim of drunk amazoning by forcing you to solve a math problem after you enter your credit card number anywhere.

This isn't really secure, it was more just made for kicks and giggles.  If you wanted to you could probably increase the security by hashing the values before you store them in local storage and then just display the last 4 digits to a user.  I'm kinda done with the project for now though.
