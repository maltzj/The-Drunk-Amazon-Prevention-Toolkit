Have you ever had a few (or more than a few) drinks and thought "you know what I need to do?  Buy some random crap at Amazon".  If you haven't, then consider yourself lucky, because there's nothing worse than waking up to $200 dollars in credit card charges and a useless pile of "deals" from Amazon headed towards your doorstep.  

This chrome extension will stop you from becoming a victim of drunk amazoning by forcing you to solve a math problem after you enter your credit card number anywhere.

Installation instructions to follow (once I figure out how to actually, you know, make this into a chrome extension).
